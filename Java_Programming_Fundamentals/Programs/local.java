//These variables are declared inside the body of a method.

//Some of the properties of a Local Variable include:
//Local variables are declared inside a method, constructor, or block.
//No access modifiers for local variables.
//These can be used only within the same block, method, or constructor where it is initialized.
//No default value after you have declared your local variable. You need to initialize your declared local variable.
//It canâ€™t be defined by a static keyword.
//Given below is the program in which we have used local variables 
//initialized within a method of a class. 
//As height is a local variable initialized with the calculate() method, 
//the scope of this variable will be confined within the method.
